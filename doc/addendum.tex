Please note the following items which were not included in the manual or other 
documentation:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\sf SciTech Software} does not supply IFF-DR2D fonts. If you are using this 
plotting option, it is likely that you already have a program such as ProVector 
which supports DR2D and will thus have some fonts. When selecting a DR2D font in 
\amplot, you should specify the complete path and fontname unless the software you 
are using to import the DR2D file has a default directory which it searches for 
DR2D fonts. Since the DR2D fonts will not be plotted on the \amplot\ screen, you 
must use the Font Translation file (See Section~5.2 in the manual) to assign a 
lookalike Amiga font. The fontname as used in font requesters should be specified 
in this file.
i.e.\ if your importing software requires a complete path \& fontname, the 
translation file must also contain a complete path \& fontname.
\end{itemize}
