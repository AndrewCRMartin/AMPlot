% Figures and tables are to be numbered sequentially throughout the
% thesis, rather than within chapters; for style consistency, do
% equations the same.  The following \def of \cl@chapter is a kludge:
% really there should be a \removefromreset, to stop figure numbers, etc.,
% from being reset at chapter beginnings
\def\cl@chapter{\@elt{section}\@elt{footnote}}
\def\thefigure{\@arabic\c@figure}
\def\thetable{\@arabic\c@table}
