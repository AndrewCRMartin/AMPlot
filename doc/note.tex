\LARGE\bf Update Manual Addendum
\end{center}
\vspace{1in}

Since printing the update manuals, a further tooltype has been added. The following
paragraph should be added to page~22.
\vspace{1in}

\noindent{\Large\bf 5.16 AXISBOUNDS}
\vspace{1em}

\noindent When producing EPSF output, \amplot\ will normally set the bounding box to encompass 
the whole plot. Setting this tooltype will cause the bounding box to match the 
dimensions of the graph axes. Depending on the program used to import the file, this 
may make it easier to place your plot accurately on the page.
\vspace{1in}
   
A line should also be added to Table~5.2 on page~20 to document this extra tooltype.
